## Instructions

1. Feel free to consult, copy from, or modify the code in `cgminer/reference/` (including `ESP-Miner/` and `bitaxeGamma/`) whenever it helps your implementation or refactoring work.
2. Apply your functional changes primarily to the files under `cgminer/` itself, keeping the reference code in sync only when necessary.
